# Buffering

You'll see seven files in the repo:

README.md: the README, duh.
Makefile: provided Makefile to build the programs.
print_file.c: a completed C program that prints the contents of a file to the screen, by reading N bytes at a time.
alice.txt: an example text file that you can use to test .
buf_io.h and buf_io.c: stub files for my code that will provide buffered I/O for reads.
buf_print_file.c: a stub file for your code that will use buf_io.h and buf_io.c to read a file using my buffering code.
